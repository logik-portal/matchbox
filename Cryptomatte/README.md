## Description
Cryptomatte - extract up to four mattes from the ID/coverage pairs generated by Arnold/Clarisse/Mantra's Cryptomatte shaders.

There's no need for this shader unless using very old Flame versions - since 2020 there's a built-in node for it: https://help.autodesk.com/view/FLAME/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-0402116E-B47C-4E32-9010-DB8C334853E0

It's crucially important to use the floating colour sampler window - pick the colours from the first input, add them to the floating swatches and only then transfer them to the shader controls!  Auto Key needs to be off as well. This works in Flame 2018 Update 1 and above. See demo:
