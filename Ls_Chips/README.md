# Ls Chips

**Author:** Lewis Saunders

**Shader Type:** Matchbox

**Action:** No

**Timeline:** No

**Transition:** No

**Minimum Flame Version:** 


## Description
Sample colours and show their names.  For sensible results the input should be sRGB or video, not scene linear or log.

Make sure to use the .mx version of this shader rather than the .glsl, to work around Flame losing the connection to the font texture grid image when the batch setup is closed!
