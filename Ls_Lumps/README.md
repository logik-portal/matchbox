## Description
Frequency separation - split image into colour, lumps and detail, A.K.A. low, mid and high frequencies.  You can gain, filter and colour correct each band, or for more complex work use three copies of this shader to split out the three bands, then rebuild the image using a fourth shader with 'Recombine inputs' on and the three bands in inputs 2/3/4.

When recombining inputs make sure all three Colour/Lumps/Detail buttons on the right are enabled so you see the full image!
