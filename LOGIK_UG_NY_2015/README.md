• Javier Mendez from CineSys-Oceana will be showing an app he developed to automate archiving in the background.
• Joel Osis from Tendril in Toronto is back to break down 2 recent jobs: One that involved giving life to 2d stills using projectors, substance textures and extended bicubics, and another showing his take on additive keying.

There will be a Flame running on a Mac Pro for people to check out, food and drinks will be provided, and at the end of the night we will be giving away some fabulous holiday prizes!
