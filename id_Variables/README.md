# id Variables

**Author:** Bob Maple

**Shader Type:** Matchbox

**Action:** No

**Timeline:** No

**Transition:** No

**Minimum Flame Version:** 


## Description
A simple null shader intended as an example for you to modify and make your own custom "Variables" matchboxes out of. Modify the .xml and call the controls whatever you want, add more or remove some, etc.

Although the shader its self does nothing, the Front (red) input is required and just passes through to the output. The Back (green) input is there for convenience allowing you to connect something else to it for use as a viewer toggle (F1/F2) without leaving the node.

Updates:

    - Remove " from shader description causing saved batch setups to fail when loading
