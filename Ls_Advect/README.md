## Description
Pushes an image along the contours of another, like ink in a river; try big soft noise on the second input.

By default the movement is 'around' the shapes in the map input, but the 'Rotate 90' button switches it to move inwards/outwards, or the 'Use map as vectors directly' allows you to use motion vectors or x/y red/green displacement maps.
