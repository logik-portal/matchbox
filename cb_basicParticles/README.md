## Description
Emitter Position: Sets the normalized (0-1) position of the particle emitter on the screen.
Particle Count: Scales the number of particles (0-2000); 0.5 = 1000 particles.
Speed: Base speed multiplier for particle movement.
Speed Variation: Random variation in particle speed (0 = uniform, 1 = max variation).
Velocity: Directional velocity (X, Y) affecting all particles.
Lifetime: Base lifetime of particles in seconds.
Lifetime Variation: Random variation in lifetime (e.g., 0.5 = Â±25% of lifeTime).
Size: Base particle size in pixels.
Size Variation: Random variation in particle size (0 = uniform, 1 = max variation).
Spawn Rate: Particles spawned per second.
Gravity: Strength of downward gravity affecting particles.
Particle Color: RGB color of the particles.
Spread: Random spread of initial velocity around velocity.
Use UV Map: Toggle between emitter position (0.0) and UV map (1.0) for spawn points.
Show Emitter: Show a red dot at the emitter position (1.0) or hide it (0.0).
Wind: Constant wind velocity (X, Y) affecting particle motion.
Turbulence: Strength of random turbulence applied over time and age.
Fade Out: Toggle fading as particles age (1.0 = fade, 0.0 = no fade).
Fade Variation: Random variation in fade timing (0 = uniform, 1 = max variation).

**ANIMATE spawnRate.

**UV input for Emitter fun.
