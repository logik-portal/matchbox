## Description
Hi Logik, it is that time again! It has been too long since the great night at ARRI in December.

  In April we invite you to Chimney to meet and talk all things Flame. Ivar will share some new shaders he has in the pipeline and James will share how Chimney is using Flame in their Shotgun pipeline and we will also look at the new 2019 release!

  Feel free to bring in some work that you want to share with the rest of the artists.

  We do not have a fireplace, but we have beer.

  Große Hamburger Straße 17, 10115 Berlin, Germany

  Hope to see you there!
